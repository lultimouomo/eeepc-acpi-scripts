* improve the display-switching script so that it handles three states:
  - internal LCD on, external - off
  - internal LCD on, external - on, one large display
  - internal LCD off, external - on

  the script should check if the Virtual setting of xorg.conf allows
  for the second mode to be engaged and report via notify() if not
    15:45 < SynrG> dam: xrandr | sed -ne '/Screen/ { s/.*maximum // ; p }'

  perhaps even the choice if two- or three-state dsplay configuration can
  be configured.

* test bluetooth toggling when both the internal adapter and an external
  adapter are present.

* investigate co-existence with acpi-support
  10:16 dam anyone remembers why do we conflct with acpi-support?
  11:58 SynrG> dam: acpi-support triggers for the wrong keys, starting scripts for the eee that shouldn't be
  11:58 SynrG> dam: and vice versa
  11:58 SynrG> because asus decided to map the keys differently
  11:58 SynrG> from all of its other stuff
  12:26 dam> so how can we co-exist with acpi-support? perhaps split acpi-support-asus and conflict only with it?
  12:28 SynrG> or file a bug on acpi-support to not respond when the system is an eee
  12:29 SynrG> start with looking over acpi-support to make sure this is still the case
  12:29 dam> hm, then it would be reasonable for us to respond only if the systemm is an eee too
  12:29 SynrG> yes

  the goal is for eeepc-acpi-scripts to be able to be installed by the installer if eee is detected
  for this, we shall not conflict with acpi-support, which is installed by default

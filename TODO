* improve the display-switching script so that it handles three states:
  - internal LCD on, external - off
  - internal LCD on, external - on, one large display
  - internal LCD off, external - on

  the script should check if the Virtual setting of xorg.conf allows
  for the second mode to be engaged and report via notify() if not
    15:45 < SynrG> dam: xrandr | sed -ne '/Screen/ { s/.*maximum // ; p }'

  perhaps even the choice if two- or three-state dsplay configuration can
  be configured.

* suspend.sh should do nothing if it deetects a running power manager. See
  lid.sh for example.

* support control node locations for bluetooth and camera for pre-2.6.26
  kernels

* move bluetooth/camera on/off parts into separate scripts under
  /etc/acpi/actions, similarly to wireless.sh

* test bluetooth toggling when both the internal adapter and an external
  adapter are present.

* add support for knotify as a notification service

* make notify() accept two arguments, type and message. To be used to provide
  icons to notification services that support it.

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version provides an /etc/modprobe.d/eeepc file containing the right
    options for pciehp kernel module.
    Since editing similar file in modprobe.d was recommended before, you may
    want to review that and possibly remove any duplicates.
    In the future /etc/modprobe.d/eeepc will contain any settings we think
    would be useful for EeePC users.

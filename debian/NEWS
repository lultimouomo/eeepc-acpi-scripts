eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

 * eeepc-acpi-scritps no longer manages lid events. If you don't use a
   power manager and want your netbook to go to slip when you close the lid,
   you can configure acpi-support accordingly in /etc/default/acpi-support

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * There is no longer any need for pciehp to be listed in /etc/modules.
    With a new-enough kernel, it is no longer required; there is a script,
    run during startup, which will load it if an older kernel is in use.

  * If you leave LOCK_SCREEN_ON_SUSPEND='yes' in
    /etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts then, with some login managers, you may
    have to use the root password when resuming after suspend-to-RAM.

    To avoid this, you will need to check that your X session is appearing
    in 'who' output:

        $ who | grep ' :0'

    If that shows your user name, you need do nothing about this.

    Otherwise, you will need to modify your login manager's configuration so
    that the session is properly registered and deregistered.

    As far as we are aware, only slim has this problem. If you use slim,
    you'll need to edit etc/slim.conf. There are two lines, initially
    commented out, containing "sessionstart_cmd" and "sessionstop_cmd". They
    need to be modified such that they contain sessreg commands and are not
    commented out, like this:

        sessionstart_cmd  	exec sessreg -a -l :0 %user
        sessionstop_cmd  	exec sessreg -d -l :0 %user

    (Specifically, the problem is known to occur with xtrlock when your X
    session wasn't registered and you have no X terminals open.)

  * If you normally compile your own kernel, you must make sure that
    rfkill-input is available else you may have problems toggling wireless
    networking with 2.6.28 and later (the kernel will do the toggling
    itself and the hotkey script will be racing against the kernel, quite
    likely switching wireless networking off again).

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version provides an /etc/modprobe.d/eeepc file containing the right
    options for pciehp kernel module.
    Since editing similar file in modprobe.d was recommended before, you may
    want to review that and possibly remove any duplicates.
    In the future /etc/modprobe.d/eeepc will contain any settings we think
    would be useful for EeePC users.

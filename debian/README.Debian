eeepc-acpi-scripts for Debian
-----------------------------

The Eee PC support for Debian is under constant improvement. Please also
check our wiki and contribute.

You may want to change the values of VOLUME_LABEL and HEADPHONE_LABEL in
/etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts if you experience problems with your sound
function keys; however, we expect that auto-detection will work. Should it
fail, you will need to get the correct values for these labels â€“ check the
output of "amixer" and set the configuration items accordingly; tell us what
you've done or ask if you need help, since it's likely to be something which
we'll need to fix anyway.

To get nifty osd overlays on changing the volume, switching on wireless
etc., change ENABLE_OSD to yes in /etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts (and make
sure you have aosd-cat installed).

/etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts contains several other configuration items,
ranging from what to do when the lid is closed to what effect various
function keys have. It also contains documentation on what to alter and how
to alter it if you want to change things.

  [ Ben Armstrong ]
  * VGA_ON and LVDS_OFF replace COMBINED_DISPLAY_SWITCHES to provide
    better default behaviour for VGA toggle.  See comments in

    mode or use xinerama-style display).
  * Blacklist useless pcspkr module.

    it will work when the external monitor is disconnected.

  * move screen locking from suspend.sh to a function in functions.sh

    display_x_display before xrandr invocation sets these up.

    reporting.

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * suspend.sh: fix detection of running shutdown.
    The code in 1.0.1 could wrongly decide that shutdown is running,
    cancelling the suspend, possibly leading to overheating if one had closed
    the lid and put the eee in its bag
  * add myself to Uploaders

    to avoid output that it is lagging behind on long key presses.
  * Adding Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git control fields.
  * Prevent the system to go into suspend after a lid event if a shutdown
    is in progress (Closes: #469505).

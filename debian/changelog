eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * Fix Super Hybrid Engine support breakage in 1.1.4.
    A missing "[" caused the AC-adaptor-unplugged code to fail; consequently,
    the preferred running-on-battery mode (the default being underclocked)
    would not be selected.
  * Set urgency=high (for documentation reasons; due to 1.1.4).
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * add DMUA flag
  * rules: add small test suite for all shell scripts

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * rules: when stripping comments from /etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts, also
    remove lines consisting solely of '#'
  * when changing Super Hybrid Engine modes, ignore models 701 and 702 which
    don't officially support S.H.E. (Closes: #559578)
    Additionally provide a variable in the default file to override the ignore

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * Init script fixups for when /etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts is missing;
    ensure that we default to "automatic" for our S.H.E. handling. 
  * Belatedly bump acpid version requirement. (Closes: #550119)
  * Bring the copyright file up to date.
  * Allow setting of whether the super hybrid engine control defaults to
    manual or auto.
  * Strip out comments from /etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts and store a
    fully-commented copy in /usr/share/doc/eeepc-acpi-scripts/examples/.
  * Add configuration support for Fn-F4 on 10" models. No action is defined.
  * Make VGA toggling into a bindable function.
  * Fix a bug which prevented touchpad toggling from working properly.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * rules: call dh_installinit with -u'start 20 S .' to prevent
    installing stop init.d symlinks as eeepc-acpi-scripts init.d script
    doesn't need to be run during system shutdown
  * postinst: remove and re-install rc.d configuration
    fixing insserv warning about discrepancy between LSB init.d headers and
    the real situation. Thanks to Paul Menzel for reporting and Raphael
    Geissert for the fix.
  * hotkey.sh/wireless.sh/functions.sh: wake up wicd on switching WiFi on
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.3 (no changes necessary)

  [ Andreas Schreiner ]
  * Fix WLAN toggle using fn-F2 on EeePC 900A. This EeePC model needs to
    load the pciehp kernel module with the pciehp_force=1 option up to kernel
    version 2.6.32. /etc/init.d/eeepc-acpi-script now checks if it is running
    on a 900A and loads the module accordingly.

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * Add support for the 'super hybrid engine', which is accessible in kernel
    2.6.30-rc7 and later, and allow for automatic upclocking when on AC and
    downclocking when on battery (default is fastest/slowest).
  * Add an option for preferring to use the 'Master' control for volume
    control & muting. Off by default; normally takes effect while booting.
  * Don't run the init script on installation or upgrade; just while
    booting. This avoids altering current settings.
  * Make touchpad toggling into a bindable function.
  * Blacklist i2c_i801 (not needed, causes a long boot delay).

  [ Thiemo Nagel ]
  * Add support for GSM (3G) toggling, automatically chosing between rfkill
    and USB methods.
  * spelling fix in the default file
  * fix actions/wireless.sh usage message

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * functions.sh: run screensaver-command as the logged in user

  [ Alan Jenkins ]
  * Remove old hacks for wireless toggle key
    There is no need to load/unload modules and ifconfig up/down the wireless
    interface. PCI hotplug takes care of it.

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * Add support for Fn-F7 (on 10xx models). Default is screen blanking.
    Add support for Fn-F3 (touchpad toggle on 10xx models).
    (Closes: #528759)
  * Rearrange hotkey handling a bit (no functional changes), fix comments
    and document keys for which we don't yet have event codes.
  * Configuration settings FnF6, FnF7, FnF8 and FnF9 are renamed to reflect
    function rather than location.
    (We've had one instance of renaming to reflect location on a 1000-series
    without corresponding fixes in the hotkey handler script.)
  * Alter the audio control blacklisting to allow for controls for which
    (for example) muting only should be allowed.
  * Add "Beep" to the audio control blacklist, but only for volume control.
  * Make sure that, if some controls is unmuted due to volume level change,
    all other relevant controls are unmuted.
  * Fix a bashism in debian/rules.

  [ Raphael Geissert ]
  * Allow fine-grained control over the lid-closing action.
  * Make init script depend on $remote_fs, we use /usr
  * Add support for OSD notifications via kdialog (Closes: #519671)
    - Thanks to Gernot Pansy <pansyg@gmx.at> for the patch
  * Bump standards-version, no change needed
  * Simplify rules file
  * Use su instead of sudo to avoid another dependency
  * Add myself to uploaders

  [ Tanguy Ortolo ]
  * Fix "[ -e $foo ]" where foo may be empty. (Closes: #532631)

  [ Santi BÃ©jar]
  * Add support for KMS in vga-toggle: when KMS (kernel mode setting) is
    used the output names have a number in the end (VGA1 and LVDS1).

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * Detect who's running an X session by looking for a controlling process
    with DISPLAY set in its environment.
    This has a useful side effect: status changes can be displayed even when
    the controlling process is a login manager.
  * Try to use rfkill when toggling wireless & bluetooth.
  * Ignore events when shutting down or rebooting.
  * Give immediate indication of pressing of Fn-F2.
  * The same ACPI key codes may be used for wireless on as well as off.
  * Allow reporting via OSD of brightness changes. (Closes: #501577)
  * Tweaked notifications a bit:
    - Replaced the heuristic for determining which should be fast
      notifications with an extra parameter.
    - Fast notifications stay around for a bit longer.
  * Made the volume stepping configurable, and set the default to 3.125%
    (which is 2dB for LineOut on at least ALC269 and ALC662).
  * Blacklist some ALSA volume controls; we want to alter only one of them.
    (Tested on ALC269 (901) and ALC662 (701).)
  * Cache audio control names etc. to avoid need to detect them every time
    the volume level is changed.
  * Enable audio power saving, defaulting to a 5-second delay before
    powering down. (snd_hda_intel power_save in /etc/modprobe.d/eeepc)
  * When locking the display, if all else fails, try xtrlock.
  * Prepare for netlink-enabled acpid: ignore lid-open events and handle
    differently-reported hotkey events.
  * Use an init script to load pciehp (if needed) and rfkill-input (if
    available; we rely on it if the kernel is 2.6.29 or newer).

  [ Raphael Geissert ]
  * Auto detect the playback devices and the playback switches
    Closes: #513552 -- Please auto detect the sound devices

  [ Ben Armstrong ]
  * Support ath5k wifi toggling and default to using it if ath_pci is not
    present.
  * Fix detection of rfkill on systems that don't have it.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * rename etc/modprobe.d/eeepc to eeepc.conf, adapting to modprobe requirement
    Closes: #518573
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.1 (no changes needed)
  * stop saving/restoring brightness on suspend

eeepc-acpi-scripts (1.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ben Armstrong ]
  * VGA_ON and LVDS_OFF replace COMBINED_DISPLAY_SWITCHES to provide
    better default behaviour for VGA toggle.  See comments in
    /etc/default/eeepc-acpi-scripts for common variations (specify
    mode or use xinerama-style display).
  * Blacklist useless pcspkr module.
  * Fix VGA toggle: default to enable LVDS / disable VGA so that
    it will work when the external monitor is disconnected.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * when "soft-disabling" bluetooth, power down the USB port
  * improve long description a bit

  [ Raphael Geissert ]
  * test for OSD_SHOWN before checking for gnome-osd for consistency
  * add support for knotify but only use it if aosd_cat is not installed
    Closes: #513551 -- please add support for knotify
  * fix typo in notify()'s usage message
  * Add support for different suspend methods, but keep pm-suspend as the
    default.
    Closes: #499545 -- Configurable FnF1 key - suspend to ram or hibernate

  * move screen locking from suspend.sh to a function in functions.sh
  * lock_x_screen: try locking KDE via dcop; Closes: #499544
  * vga-toggle.sh: run detect_x_display before xrandr xrandr needs a
    proper X session available - DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY. Calling
    display_x_display before xrandr invocation sets these up.
    Closes: #500191 -- vga-toggle does nothing. Thanks to John Goerzen for
    reporting.
